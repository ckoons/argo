## Common Workflows

### I want to...

**...create a simple workflow**
1. Read [WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md](WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md) "Quick Start" section
2. Copy a template from `../../workflows/templates/`
3. Modify to your needs
4. Test with `arc start <workflow> <instance>`

**...understand what step type to use**
1. Check [WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md](WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md) "Step Types Reference"
2. Look at examples for each step type
3. Review example workflows in `../../workflows/templates/`

**...debug a failing workflow**
1. Check workflow logs: `cat ~/.argo/logs/<workflow_id>.log`
2. Review [WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md](WORKFLOW_CONSTRUCTION.md) "Debugging Workflows"
3. Verify step JSON syntax matches step type requirements

**...contribute a new feature**
1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) completely
2. Study [DAEMON_ARCHITECTURE.md](DAEMON_ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand system
3. Follow coding standards in project root `CLAUDE.md`
4. Write tests for your feature

**...understand how Argo works internally**
1. Start with [DAEMON_ARCHITECTURE.md](DAEMON_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Review [INITIALIZATION.md](INITIALIZATION.md) for startup sequence
3. Study code in `src/daemon/` and `src/workflow/`
