- [ ] Git helper functions
- [ ] JSON parsing and validation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] project_intake → design_program handoff
- [ ] design_program → build_program handoff
- [ ] Builder state monitoring

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Simple tool creation (no parallelization)
- [ ] Program creation (optional parallelization)
- [ ] Project creation (full GitHub flow)

## Dependencies

### Required Tools
- [x] bash 4.0+
- [x] jq (JSON processing)
- [x] git
- [ ] gh (GitHub CLI) - needs installation
- [x] ci (Argo CI tool)

### Optional Tools (for complex modules)

## Current Sprint: Phase 5 - NEXT

**Goal**: Advanced features (failure handling and conflict resolution)
**Start**: 2025-10-22
**Target**: 2025-10-27 (5 days)

**Next actions**:
1. Parent failure handling (analyze builder test results, test refactoring)
2. Merge conflict resolution (trivial auto-resolution, complex handling)
3. Builder respawn logic
4. User escalation patterns

**Optional**: These features can be added later as needed.
