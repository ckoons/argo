 * Args:
 *   path: Path to file to read
 *   buffer: Pointer to receive allocated buffer (caller must free)
 *   size: Pointer to receive file size (can be NULL)

 * Returns:
 *   ARGO_SUCCESS on success
 *   E_SYSTEM_FILE if file cannot be opened
 *   E_SYSTEM_MEMORY if allocation fails
 *   E_INVALID_PARAMS if path or buffer is NULL
 *
 * Note: Buffer is null-terminated and caller must free() it
