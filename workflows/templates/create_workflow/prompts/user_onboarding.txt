Welcome to the Argo Workflow Creator!

I'll help you create a new workflow template by asking a few questions.
We'll work together to define what you want, how to test it, and
what success looks like.

This process has three phases:
  1. Requirements gathering - Tell me what you want
  2. Design dialog - We'll refine the approach together
  3. Build phase - I'll create the template
