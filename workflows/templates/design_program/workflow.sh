$REQUIREMENTS

Provide a detailed design covering:

1. **Architecture Overview**: High-level structure (single file, modules, classes, etc.)

2. **Component Breakdown**: What are the main components and their responsibilities?

3. **Data Structures**: What data structures are needed? (files, database, memory, etc.)

4. **Interface Design**: Command-line arguments, flags, input/output format

5. **Error Handling**: What can go wrong and how to handle it

6. **Testing Strategy**: How to test each component

7. **File Structure**: What files/directories should be created

8. **Implementation Steps**: Ordered steps to build this (for build_program to follow)

Be specific and actionable. Focus on clarity over cleverness.
